-- SPECIFIC REFERENCES:
-- The references in this section are for unique or novel concepts that
-- I was specifically struggling with while working on the HMM project.
-- This file should generally contain at least one inline citation for
-- every reference I used while working on HMM
-- 
-- Authors credited for StackExchange posts are done in the following
-- format:
-- [MyFavoriteAnswererName; QuestionAskerName; et al...]
-- Since the favorite answer for my use case and the queston asker
-- seem they should get the most credit

-- GENERAL REFERENCES:
-- The references in listed in this section were overarching and
-- general.  They were used so frequently that it doesn't make sense to
-- use an inline citation *every* single time they were referenced.  In
-- the event something very unique or novel from those references is
-- used that unique or novel though will be cited.  Otherwise, do not
-- expect to see inline citations of these sources scattered all over
-- the source code

-- REFERNCE APPOLOGY:
-- While I would like for this to be an academic work, it is not
-- one.  This code is written in haste because I have a day job.
-- If I've accidently missed someone that has signifiantly helped
-- me without citing then or a "parent"/similar source, I appologize.
-- I will try to correct the situation when I become aware.  Also,
-- things that are common knowlege are not required to be cited, but
-- with me being a paranoid person, I tend to cite whenever I get
-- help
